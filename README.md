# My Reads  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fschwalm/my-reads.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fschwalm/my-reads)
Final assessment project for Udacity's React Nanodegree - Module I - Fundamentals.

I explore concepts such as:  

Composition Model  
Declarative Nature  
Unidirectional data flow  
React Router
Controlled Components  

### Demo  
[My-reads](https://fschwalm.github.io/my-reads/#/)

### Requirement  
> In the MyReads project, you'll create a bookshelf app that allows you to
select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to
read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides
an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as
you interact with the application.
